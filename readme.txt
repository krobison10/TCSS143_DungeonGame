For extra credit I implemented both the pit and the vision potion feature. I also implemented a few other little things
like help menus and a stat system that can display the players stats at any time and displays them at the end which may
possibly be deserving of a little extra credit. I also in my potion method make sure that the player can't heal past full health, and if the potion value would allow them to, it only brings them to full health, I'm not sure if that was a requirement or not so if not then it is an extra feature.
Note that there is no implementation of combat or the Heroes vs Monsters classes because I didn't do that one and don't have
those classes, I implemented a basic version of a monster where the hero loses a lot of health after encountering and fighting a monster though. Other than that, all of the other requirements are in tact. Except for one issue, in my putCrowns method I have it set up to 
keep randomly generating points until the crowns are in unique spots from the entrances and exits and each other but sometimes there's this bug where a crown gets placed in the exit room or for some reason never makes it on to the board, I have no idea why this happens and am curious if you have any insight as to why. It only happens rarely so I decided not to waste a whole day trying to fix it but it does bug me, no pun intended.
